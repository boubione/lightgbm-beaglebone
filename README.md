## Overview

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed for distributed and efficient training. This repository provides a lightweight version that can run on edge devices, ensuring that machine learning can be performed in resource-constrained environments.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Designed to use minimal resources.
- **No SciPy Dependency**: Reduces installation complexity.
- **Optimized for ARM**: Tailored for BeagleBone and similar devices.
- **Precompiled Binaries**: Simplifies installation and usage.
- **Supports Regression**: Perfect for tasks that require regression analysis.

## Installation

To install the lightgbm-beaglebone package, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/boubione/lightgbm-beaglebone/releases).
2. **Execute the downloaded file** to install the package.

This package includes precompiled binaries for easy setup. Ensure that your BeagleBone device is running Debian 10.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use LightGBM in your Python projects. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to implement it:

```python
import lightgbm as lgb

# Prepare your dataset
data = lgb.Dataset('data.txt')

# Set parameters
params = {
    'objective': 'regression',
    'metric': 'rmse',
}

# Train the model
model = lgb.train(params, data, num_boost_round=100)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to load your dataset, set parameters, train the model, and make predictions.

## Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started:

### Example 1: Basic Regression

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100)

# Create dataset
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X, label=y)

# Define parameters
params = {
    'objective': 'regression',
    'metric': 'rmse',
}

# Train model
model = lgb.train(params, train_data, num_boost_round=100)

# Predict
preds = model.predict(X)
```

### Example 2: Hyperparameter Tuning

You can tune hyperparameters to improve your model's performance. Use techniques like grid search or random search.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
import lightgbm as lgb

# Define the model
model = lgb.LGBMRegressor()

# Define parameters for grid search
param_grid = {
    'num_leaves': [31, 50],
    'max_depth': [-1, 10, 20],
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(X, y)

# Best parameters
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```
